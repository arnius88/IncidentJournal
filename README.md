<h1>Incident Handler's Journal</h1>


<h2>Project description</h2>

This activity allowed me to practice applying my documentation skills to complete journal entries about different scenarios. Accurate and thorough documentation helps to ensure that important information is not lost or overlooked, and it also allows security professionals to capture aspects of an incident for future use.

In each example, I analyzed the scenario provided by applying the five W's of incident handling:
<br />

- **Who** caused the incident? A brief mention of the individuals involved in the event.<br />
- **What** happened? A description of the incident's nature.<br />
- **When** did the incident occur? Pinpointing the exact time of the incident.<br />
- **Where** did the incident happen? Identifying the affected areas of the system.<br />
- **Why** did the incident happen? Understanding the root causes of the incident.<br />

Answering the above questions is fundamental to collect the relevant information necessary to form the full picture of the event and be able to respond appropriately.
<br />

In a few cases, the entry is describing my experience with using a tool for the first time, therefore it was not possible to answer the five W's. In these cases I tried to describe as accurately as possible my experience and impressions.<br />

<h2>Reflections</h2>

1.	Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?
The activities were not challenging per-se, they all made sense to me. I was able to follow the logic of the instructions However, it occurred to me that giving myself the time to keep practicing with the tools and challenge myself with new scenarios is extremely important. Mainly because it could take a while to remember how to use them and where to look for things. This also applies to certain concepts, such as network protocols, which might require me to dedicate some time to become more familiar with.

2.	Has your understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?
I am much more confident about my understanding of the different stages of the incident response cycle. The concept that I found the most useful was the triage process, which has widened my perspective on how to handle security events. It made me understand the importance of resource allocation and the necessity to have a degree of certainty that an event is a security incident before reacting and responding.

3.	Was there a specific tool or concept that you enjoyed the most? Why?
I enjoyed practicing with the SIEM tools, in particular Chronicle and Splunk. Although it was the first time that I was introduced to such software, I managed to find my way around after a few attempts. Admittedly, it takes some time to get used to their interfaces, because there are lots of options and they display a lot of information simultaneously. However, the experience clarified how the use of SIEM fits into the broader system monitoring activity.
