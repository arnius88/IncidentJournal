<h1>Incident Handler's Journal</h1>


<h2>Project description</h2>

This activity allowed me to practice applying my documentation skills to complete journal entries about different scenarios. Accurate and thorough documentation helps to ensure that important information is not lost or overlooked, and it also allows security professionals to capture aspects of an incident for future use.

In each example, I analyzed the scenario provided by applying the five W's of incident handling:
<br />

- **Who** caused the incident? A brief mention of the individuals involved in the event.<br />
- **What** happened? A description of the incident's nature.<br />
- **When** did the incident occur? Pinpointing the exact time of the incident.<br />
- **Where** did the incident happen? Identifying the affected areas of the system.<br />
- **Why** did the incident happen? Understanding the root causes of the incident.<br />

Answering the above questions is fundamental to collect the relevant information necessary to form the full picture of the event and be able to respond appropriately.
<br />

In a few cases, the entry is describing my experience with using a tool for the first time, therefore it was not possible to answer the five W's. In these cases I tried to describe as accurately as possible my experience and impressions.<br />

<h2>Reflections</h2>

1.	**Were there any specific activities that were challenging for you? Why or why not?** <br />

The activities were not challenging per se. I was able to follow the logic of the instructions. However, I realized that giving myself the time to keep practicing with some of the tools (e.g. Suricata) and challenge myself with new scenarios is extremely important. This is mainly because it could take a while to remember how to use them and where to look for things. I believe that this also applies to certain concepts, such as network protocols, which means that I will need to dedicate some time to become more familiar with them.
<br />

2.	**Has my understanding of incident detection and response changed after taking this course?** <br />

I feel much more confident about my understanding of the different stages of the incident response cycle. The concept that I found the most useful was the triage process, which has widened my overall perspective on how to handle security events. Knowing about triaging made me understand the importance of resource allocation and the necessity to have a degree of certainty that an event is actually a security incident before reacting and responding.<br />

3.	**Was there a specific tool or concept that I enjoyed the most? Why?** <br />

I enjoyed practicing with SIEM tools, in particular Chronicle and Splunk. Although it was the first time that I was introduced to such pieces of software, I managed to find my way around them after a few attempts. Admittedly, it might take some time to get used to their interfaces, because there are lots of options and they display a lot of information simultaneously. However, the experience clarified how monitoring systems with SIEMs fits into the usual day-to-day activities of a cybersecurity analyst.<br />
